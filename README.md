## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Taskly is a simple yet powerful to-do application built with Django to manage tasks efficiently. It allows users to create tasks, categorize them, and manage deadlines. The app is intended for learning purposes and to showcase Django development skills.

The project is structured to highlight Django‚Äôs key features like custom models, migrations, and working with MySQL databases.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Follow the steps below to set up this project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv for dependency management
- MySQL database server

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/behailu-sileshi/django-todo-app.git
        cd django-todo-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
        pipenv install --dev
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
         pipenv shell
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
        SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
        DEBUG=True
        NAME='taskly'         # MySQL Database Name
        HOST='localhost'      # Database Host
        USER='root'           # MySQL Username
        PASSWORD='your-password'  # MySQL Password
   ```

5. Run migrations to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:
   ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
   ```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
